# C4ID

NodeJS module to generate C4 IDs. As described in [SMPTE ST 2114:2017](https://pub.smpte.org/latest/st2114/st2114-2017.pdf), a C4 ID
is a 64 byte SHA512 hash, represented as a 90 character, Base58 string. This package does not create SHA512 hashes, it simply converts
them to C4 IDs.

## Installing / Getting started

  ```shell
  $ npm install --save c4id
  ```

  ```javascript
  import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';
  import C4ID from 'c4id';

  const digest = createHash('sha512').update('alfa').digest();
  const c4 = C4ID.fromSHA512Hash(digest);

  console.log(c4); //c43zYcLni5LF9rR4Lg4B8h3Jp8SBwjcnyyeh4bc6gTPHndKuKdjUWx1kJPYhZxYt3zV6tQXpDs2shPsPYjgG81wZM1
  ```

## API Reference

#### Functions

Function | Argument Type | Return Type | Description
------ | ------------- | ----------- |------------
fromSHA512Hash(*sha512Hash*) | Buffer | string | Takes a SHA512 hash and returns a C4 ID string.
toSHA512Digest(*c4id*) | string | Buffer | Takes a C4 ID and returns a SHA512 hash digest.
fromIds(*c4ids*) | string[] | string | [SMPTE ST 2114:2017](https://pub.smpte.org/latest/st2114/st2114-2017.pdf) describes a method to generate a C4 ID from other C4 IDs (e.g. to generate a single C4 ID from multiple files in the same folder). This function will take an array of C4 IDs and return a single C4 ID from the input, as specified in [SMPTE ST 2114:2017](https://pub.smpte.org/latest/st2114/st2114-2017.pdf).
